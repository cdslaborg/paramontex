    "> In optimization and Monte Carlo sampling problems, since the mathematical objective functions (e.g., probability density functions) can take extremely small or large values, we often work with their natural logarithms instead. **This is the reason behind the naming convention used in the ParaMonte library for** the user's objective functions: **getLogFunc**, implying that **the user must provide a function that returns the natural logarithm of the target objective function**.  \n",

    "Suppose we want to sample this MVN Probability Density Function (PDF) via the [ParaMonte Monte Carlo simulation library](https://github.com/cdslaborg/paramonte/). To do so, the ParaMonte library sampler routines will make repeated calls to this objective function that we have implmented in the above.  \n",

    "\n",
    "+ The evaluation of this function involves a `log(exp())` term in its definition. If the origin of the `exp()` term is not clear to you, take a look at the definition of the MVN distribution in the equation provided in the above.  **This is computationally very expensive** and in general, is considered a bad implementation.  \n",
    "  \n",
    "  \n",
    "+ The evaluation of the function as implemented in the above requires an inverse-covariance matrix computation on each call made to `getLogFunc_bad()`. **This is completely redundant** as the value of the covariance matrix -- and therefore, its inverse -- does not change throughout the simulation. Consequently, **a lot of computational resources are wasted for nothing**.  \n",
    "  \n",
    "  \n",
    "+ The above implementation of the MVN distribution is quite prone to numerical **overflow** and **underflow**, which could **cause the simulations to crash at runtime**. For example, when the input value for `point` happens to be too far from the `mean` of the MVN distribution, it is likely for the resulting MVN PDF value to be so small that the computer rounds it to zero. Then `np.log(0.0)` in `getLogFunc_bad()` becomes undefined and the simulation crashes. That would only be the best-case scenario in which the crash will alert you about the problem. But more frequently, your code may not even complain that it is working with infinities and not doing any useful work.\n",
    "  \n",
    "It is, therefore, important to implement a **numerically efficient**, **fault-tolerant** MVN PDF calculator that resolves all of the above concerns. This is possible if we take a second look at the equation for the MVN PDF in the above and try directly implement its logarithm as our computational objective function,"
